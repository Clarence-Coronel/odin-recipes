                <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

                <li><em>2 </em>tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li><em>1 </em>tablespoon capers, drained</li>

                <li><em>¼ </em>cup fresh lemon juice</li>
                    <li><em>¼ </em>cup water</li>
                    <li><em>3 </em>tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>

            </ul>
                <hr>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                    <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken breasts with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
                    <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
                    <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through, about 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
            </ol>
